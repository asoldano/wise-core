 Building and running the testsuite
------------------------------------

The build follows the usual Maven flow; a wilflyXYZ profile has to be specified to tell the project which target container to use for integration tests; if no wildflyXYZ profile is specified, the integration tests are skipped.

To run the full integration testsuite against the currently supported target containers use:
> mvn -Pwildfly800 clean integration-test
> mvn -Pwildfly810 clean integration-test
> mvn -Pwildfly821 clean integration-test
> mvn -Pwildfly902 clean integration-test
> mvn -Pwildfly1000 clean integration-test

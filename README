 Building and running the testsuite
------------------------------------

The build follows the usual Maven flow; a wilflyXYZ profile has to be specified to tell the project which target container to use for integration tests; if no wildflyXYZ profile is specified, the integration tests are skipped.

> mvn -PwildflyXYZ integration-test
